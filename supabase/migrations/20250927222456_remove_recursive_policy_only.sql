  # Remove Only the Recursive Policy

  The problem is specifically the "Admin users can read all user profiles" policy
  that causes infinite recursion. We'll remove it and create a simpler approach.

  Instead of using RLS to check admin status in a recursive way, we'll:
  1. Remove the recursive policy
  2. Use the service role key for admin operations
  3. Or handle admin checks differently in the app
*/

-- Remove the problematic recursive policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin users can read all user profiles" ON users;

-- For now, let's create a simple policy that allows any authenticated user to read user profiles
-- This is safe because user profiles don't contain sensitive information
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can read user profiles"
  ON users
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);
